Its \nmain focus is on two main sectors:\n\t\n1. HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning)\n\t\n2. Installation and Maintenance\n\t\n3. Direct Sale.\n\n====================================================================================================\nBLK’s excellence in the field of HVAC has made it one of the industry leaders \nand quickly secured our place as the leading provider of these services in \nKuwait.\nThanks to our relentless work and dedication to the field, we were able to \nbuild our massive facilities and equip them with the latest technologies \navailable in the industry – and we continue to regularly update them with \nemerging technologies that can make us more productive, more efficient, \nand more advanced.\nThose highly advanced modern facilities are now able to fulfill the needs of \nall our clients and can help us ramp up the production of staggering num-\nbers.\nWe can keep our standards of efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction \nis high as they are and strive to even do better with the help of our profes-\nsional teams that consist of only the most experienced and highly skilled \nengineers and managers – all of whom go through tough qualifying and \ntraining processes to guarantee excellence in every part of our work, for all \nof our clients, all of the time.\nThanks to our steady flow of customers, we were able to expand in reaching \nnew clients and offer new services. We have also established several new \nbranches in various areas of Kuwait to meet the growing customer demand \nfor our services and products while keeping the same standards of quality, \nefficiency, and customer satisfaction.\nWe have been able to consistently provide the highest quality work for the \nbest prices in the air conditioning installation and maintenance industry, \nmaking us a very competitive option and a strong player in the field of HVAC \nin Kuwait.\n31\n\n====================================================================================================\n32\nMAINTENANCE\nAbout Us\nOur Engineering division has also proven their technical excellence and strong \nabilities through a vast and impressive track record of completed projects in \nboth the private and government sectors and for some of the biggest names \non the world. We were able to complete projects such as outfitting commer-\ncial buildings, residential complexes, and hundreds of villas throughout Ku-\nwait.\nWe have taken on some big projects for both the government and private \nsectors and were able to complete them and we’ve also been able to com-\nplete projects on a smaller scale throughout Kuwait such as villas, govern-\nment buildings, private homes, etc.\nWe are proud of our ISO Quality certification and continue to execute all of our \nwork at the highest international industry standards. We also have internal \nquality control processes to ensure services and products are free from faults \nand defects and this also applies to all services provided by BLK Co.\n\n====================================================================================================\n33\nWhy do we Stand Out?\nAlthough you may find competitors that offer seemingly similar services to \nours, BLK still stands out from the crowd easily. Our thorough and deep un-\nderstanding of the local market, our efficient and innovative strategies, and \nour professionalism in conducting our work ensure that the overall quality of \nservice we offer is truly unique and remarkable in all aspects.\nOur commitment to customer satisfaction remains our driving force and the \nbest way to explain all of the decisions taken. We take pride in our commit-\nment to transparency with our clients and in the trust we have been able to \nbuild with all our past customers.\nHere are the reasons you should choose us:\n1. A reliable and accountable business\n\t\na. When dealing with a large business such as us, you get a level of \nreliability and accountability that you don’t get anywhere else.\n2. Customer Service Center\n\t\na. Whenever you call us, at anytime of the day in any day of the year, \nwe’ll pick up your call and take your request.\n3. Internal Communications\n\t\na.

We always use original spare parts that have been imported from \nthe original manufacturers in the US, Japan, Europe, or their local deal-\ner. Needless to say, these parts function much better and live much lon-\nger than the cheaper copies available in the market. They also come with \ntheir guarantees. Overall, they save you more money on the long-run than \nif you were to go with the cheaper and much lower-quality alternative.\n\n====================================================================================================\n35\nWhat Types of Contracts Do We Offer?\nWe offer a number of different types of contracts for our clients that can \nsatisfy their needs:\n•\t\nSilver Contract: A Preventative maintenance contract that also covers \nall emergencies.

These tents are durable, fungus proof, water proof, \nfire resistant and are engineered for the harsh desert climate. The superior \nquality PVC, originated from the U.S.A or Europe, is made with rip-stop and has \na high gloss finish making it easy to clean and dry. The tents easily withstand \nsustained winds over 120km per hour. The steel structure is guaranteed for 5 \nyears, the architectural weather span fabric for 3 years, and all other parts for \n1 year. The structures have an estimated life of over 15 years.\nBLK Logistics can produce any required size with a maximum width of 30 \nAMERICAN TENTS\n(Temporary Fabric Structures)\n6\n\n====================================================================================================\nmeters (100 ft).
